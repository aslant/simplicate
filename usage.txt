  
  USAGE
  
    simplicate -s <src> | -t <tar>  [-d <doc_ids>] [-f <filter> [-q <query_params>]] [-c] [-v] [<couch_server>]
  
  
  OPTIONS
  
    <couch_server>
      The CouchDB Server to which the /_replicate request is posted.
      Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:5984
    
    -s <src>
    -t <tar>
      One or both of source and target must be supplied.
      Where only one is specified, it should be the full URL to the database.
      In this case it is inferred that the other database - on <couch_server> - will have the same name.
    
    -d <doc_ids>
      Replicate only documents with supplied ids.
      e.g. -d '[ "id1", "id2" ]'
    
    -f <filter>
      Apply a filter function from a design document when replicating.
      e.g. -f a_design_doc/some_filter_fn
    
    -q <query_params>
      Query parameters can be supplied to the filter function.
      e.g. -f a_design_doc/some_filter_fn -q '{ "aKey": "aVal" }'
    
    -c
      Continuous replication
    
    -v
      Run `curl` with verbose flag
  
  
  N.B. create_target is always set to true.


  ABBREVIATED URLS

    If a port is supplied but the protocol and hostname are both ommitted, then the protocol and port are inferred as 
    `http://127.0.0.1`.

    For example
      `:9999/foo_db` is mapped to `http://127.0.0.1:9999/foo_db`
      `:8888` is mapped to `http://127.0.0.1:8888`
